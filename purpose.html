            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Can't say I enjoyed these design labs all that much. Didn't learn anything from the teacher which she explicitly taught. Everything was by myself, AGAIN! I'm getting tired of relying on myself. I know that was much of the reason I came to this school to force myself to be independent, but over time it just gets ridiculous. I learned about a teacher I will have next year, regrettably, about video editing, practice photography, and beamer.</p>
