            <p>This is a portfolio of that which I've created at this school. I can't say it's anything worth looking at, but since this is an assignment that teensy-tiny fact is irrelevant. Pardon me.</p>
            <h3><a href="web_design.html">Web Design</a></h3>
            <p>I took web design to fulfill my VAPA credits during intersession. We created some websites there.</p>
            <h3><a href="english.html">English</a></h3>
            <p>Had Mr. Sullivan for 9th grade English.</p>
            <h3><a href="photography.html">Photography</a></h3>
            <p>Had Mr. Stamper and then, I'm assuming, Ms. Gentzke. I just may have failed this class...</p>
            <h3><a href="music.html">Music</a></h3>
            <p>Since I have nothing else I might as well put a page that contains some music. I mean who isn't seduced by rhythm?</p>
