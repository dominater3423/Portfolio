        <h3>Instructor and Class</h3>
        <p>Intersession is an eight week program that the school does it two-week intervals throughout the school year. You get to choose the class of your choice given the plethora of options. I did web design. Can't say it's very intensive or the instructor has made all that much of an effort to expand our knowledge, but at least we just get to create something. I did check the early stuff I've done and my skills have improved. Can't call it a complete waste I guess.</p>
        <h3>Github</h3>
        <p>My github, which is under my school email, is: dominater3423</p>
