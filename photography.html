            <p>I swear, I did pick something up. The class in the first semester was taught horribly, which seems to be a recurring theme, unfortunately. It did get better after the new teacher came, so credit to her. I'm pretty good with a camera at this point, so I did learn something. Though I bet if I wanted to I could've picked up these skills in a month by myself.</p>
            <p>The one I have that's actually worth taking a look at is the photo essay, though I sort of ditched that. It's less of an essay, more of a compilation of image I thought looked nice, which I, oh course, took.</p>
